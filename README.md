# Payment-Fraud-Detection

### Introduction:

In the realm of financial services and mobile money transactions, the need for effective fraud detection systems is paramount. This is where this credit card fraud detection machine learning project steps in.

### About the Dataset:

This project utilizes a synthetic dataset generated by the PaySim simulator, designed to address the scarcity of publicly accessible financial datasets. PaySim leverages aggregated data from private sources to create a synthetic dataset that closely emulates the dynamics of real-world transactions.

### Content:

The dataset is a product of PaySim's simulation of mobile money transactions, drawing inspiration from actual financial logs spanning one month of activity in an African country. The source logs were shared by a multinational company offering mobile financial services across the globe. Through PaySim, the authors of the dataset has replicated real-world like transactions, encompassing five distinct categories: CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT, and TRANSFER.

### Objective:

My project aims to deliver a comprehensive analysis of this dataset, beginning with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into its structure and characteristics. Subsequently, I embark on a journey of feature engineering, crafting informative attributes that enhance the predictive power of our models.

### Methodology:

To determine the most effective fraud detection model, I employ a variety of machine learning algorithms. These models will be rigorously evaluated and compared, using statistical metrics to gauge their performance. My ultimate goal is to identify the model that excels in detecting fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives and false negatives.
